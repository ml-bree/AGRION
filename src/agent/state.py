"""Milestone 1 — the shared graph state.

`FarmerState` is the single object threaded through every node. Nodes return
partial dicts; LangGraph merges them into this shape. The `channel_type` field
is what lets the final formatter know whether it is writing for a 182-char USSD
page, a 160-char SMS, or an unconstrained web chatbot.

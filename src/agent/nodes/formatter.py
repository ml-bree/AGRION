"""Milestone 4 — the Dynamic Channel Formatter.

The experts produced deep, unconstrained reasoning. This node is the strict
editor: it reshapes that reasoning into the exact technical format the farmer's
channel can render, driven entirely by ``state['channel_type']``.

A hard validation pass (`fit_to_channel`) runs *after* the LLM, because models
routinely overshoot character budgets. For SMS/USSD it truncates on a safe
boundary and logs the overflow; for the chatbot it passes through.
